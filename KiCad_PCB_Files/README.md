The spot welder is made of two boards which are stacked on top of each other.
One board contains all the logic and low power electronic components and the other one contains the Mosfets.

Update (01.2017): Spot_welder_v3_gerber.zip is now accepted by pcb way without problems

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gerber files are made to be used at pcbway.com

This way you get a 5$ coupon for your order and i get some credits at the shop which i can use for upcoming projects.


There are two versions of the gerber files available.

1.
You can use the Spot_welder_v3_gerber.zip which has both boards combined to one big board. 
You have to cut this in half at home to get the two single boards.

2.
You can use the Arduino_Board_Gerber.zip and the Mosfet_Board_Gerber.zip . So you have one gerber file for each board. 
This means you have to order both boards seperately which is more expensive, but no cutting at home is required.
(these are not the latest Version at the moment, i will update them in some weeks.)


To download the files please download the complete project by clicking on the "clone or download" button on the projects main page (https://github.com/KaeptnBalu/Arduino_Spot_Welder_V2)
Downloading by right click and "save as" does seem to cause problems.
